## Test the generic component

After you configure your generic component, navigate to the [Control tab](/platform/fleet/robots/#control) and select the dropdown panel dedicated to the generic component.
Use the card to send arbitrary commands to the resource with [`DoCommand()`](/platform/build/configure/components/generic/#docommand).
