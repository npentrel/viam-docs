After you configure the base, go to the [**Control**](/platform/fleet/robots/#control) tab and expand the base component to view the controls to enable keyboard or [discrete](/platform/get-started/try-viam/try-viam-tutorial/#discrete-movement-control) control over your robot's movement.
If your base makes use of a [camera](/platform/build/configure/components/camera/) component, the **Control** tab for your base will also display a **Live Feeds** section.
This section contains buttons to toggle cameras on or off and to arrange how you view the camera feeds.
