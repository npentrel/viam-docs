[`Stop`](/build/configure/components/motor/#stop) | Cut power to the motor off immediately, without any gradual step down.
[`GetGeometries`](/build/configure/components/motor/#getgeometries) | Get all the geometries associated with the motor in its current configuration, in the [frame](/mobility/frame-system/) of the motor.
[`DoCommand`](/build/configure/components/motor/#docommand) | Send or receive model-specific commands.
[`Close`](/build/configure/components/motor/#close) | Safely shut down the resource and prevent further use.
