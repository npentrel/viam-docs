If your encoder is not working as expected, follow these steps:

1. Check your machine logs on the **LOGS** tab to check for errors.
2. Review this encoder model's documentation to ensure you have configured all required attributes.
3. Click on the **TEST** panel on the **CONFIGURE** or **CONTROL** tab and test if you can use the encoder there.

If none of these steps work, reach out to us on the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/viam) and we will be happy to help.
