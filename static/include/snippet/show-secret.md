{{< alert title="API key and secret" color="info" >}}
By default, the sample code does not include your robot api key and secret.
We strongly recommend that you add your api key and secret as an environment variable and import this variable into your development environment as needed.

To show your robot's api key and secret in the sample code, toggle **Include secret** on the **Code sample** tab.
You can also see your api key and secret on the [locations page](/manage/fleet/locations/).
