`viam-server` now initializes and configures resources in the correct order.
For example, if the SLAM service depends on a LiDAR, it will always initialize the LiDAR before the SLAM service.

If you are using the SLAM service, you now need to specify sensors used by the SLAM service in the `depends_on` field of the SLAM configuration.
Other service configurations are not affected.
