Viam has written a module that allows you to filter data based on specific criteria before syncing it to [Viam's cloud](/data/cloud-sync/).
It equips machines to:

- Remove data that is not of interest
- Facilitate high-interval captures while saving data based on your defined metrics
- Prevent the upload of unnecessary data

To learn more, see [this tutorial](/tutorials/configure/pet-photographer/) on creating and configuring a data filtration module.
