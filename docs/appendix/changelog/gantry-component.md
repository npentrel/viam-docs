To better control gantries with Viam, you can now:

- Specify speed values when calling the `MovetoPosition` method on [Gantry components](/components/gantry/).
  This allows you to define the speed at which each axis moves to the desired position, providing enhanced precision and control over the gantry's movement.
- Set a home position for Gantry components to facilitate position resetting or maintain consistent starting points.
