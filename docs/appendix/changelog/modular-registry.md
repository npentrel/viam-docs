The [Modular Registry](/registry/) enables you to use, create, and share custom modules, extending the capabilities of Viam beyond the components and services that are natively supported.

You can:

- Publish modules on the registry
- Add modules to any machine's configuration with a few clicks
- Select the desired module version for deployment, make changes at your convenience, and deploy the updates to a single machine or an entire fleet.
