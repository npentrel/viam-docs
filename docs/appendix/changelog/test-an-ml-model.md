After you upload and train a machine learning model, you can test its results in the **Data** tab.

This allows you to refine models by iteratively tagging more images for training based on observed performance.

For more information, see [Test classification models with existing images in the cloud](/ml/vision/mlmodel/#existing-images-in-the-cloud).

To use this update, the classifier must have been trained or uploaded after September 19, 2023.
The current version of this feature exclusively supports classification models.
