You can now access {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="fragment" text="fragments" >}} in your machine setup.
The configurations you added will now show up automatically in the **Components** or **Services** subtabs in the **Builder** view.
This makes it easier to monitor what fragments you've added to your machine and how they're configured.

For more information, see [Fragments](/build/configure/#fragments).
