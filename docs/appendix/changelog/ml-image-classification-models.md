You can now [train](/ml/train-model/) and [deploy](/ml/deploy/#create-an-ml-model-service) image classification models with the [data management service](/data/) and use your machine's image data directly within Viaml
Additionally, you can [upload and use](/ml/upload-model/) existing machine learning models with your machines.
For more information on using data synced to the cloud to train machine learning models, read [Train a model](/ml/train-model/).
