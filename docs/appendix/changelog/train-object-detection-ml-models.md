You now have the capability to directly [train object detection models](/ml/train-model/) in addition to image classification models from within the Viam app.

This update allows you to:

- Add labels by drawing bounding boxes around specific objects in your images or a single image.
- Create a curated subset of data for training by filtering images based on labels or tags.
