A new parameter, [`constraint`](/mobility/motion/constraints/), has been added to the [Motion service API](/mobility/motion/#api), allowing you to define restrictions on the machine's movement.
The constraint system also provides flexibility to specify that obstacles should only impact specific frames of a machine.
