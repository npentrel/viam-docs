The [Cartographer-module](/mobility/slam/cartographer/) now runs in Viam's cloud for creating or updating maps.
This enhancement allows you to:

- Generate larger maps without encountering session timeouts
- Provide IMU input to improve map quality
- Save maps to the **SLAM library** tab
- Create or update maps using previously captured LiDAR and IMU data
- Deploy maps to machines
