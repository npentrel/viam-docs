Now when you invite collaborators to join your organization, you can assign permissions to members by setting one of these roles:

- **Owner**: These members can see and edit [every tab on the machine page](/fleet/machines/#navigating-the-machine-page), as well as manage users in the app.
  This role is best for those on your team who are actively engineering and building machines.

- **Operator**: These members can only see and use the [remote control tab](/fleet/machines/#control).
  This role is best for those on your team who are teleoperating or remotely controlling machines.

For more information about assigning permissions and collaborating with others on Viam, see [Fleet Management](/fleet/).
