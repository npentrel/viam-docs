When using a RoboClaw motor controller without encoders connected to your motors, you now have more direct control over the RoboClawâ€™s functionality within Viam or through the motor API.

For example, in the Viam app, you can now set **Go For** values for these motors, utilizing a time-based estimation for the number of revolutions.
